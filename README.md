# project-management-web-app
* This is my final project for bachelor's degree at FERIT.
* Application is intended for use between team members on a project.
* It offers options to members such as creating a project, commenting on a project, monitoring project progress, deleting project, editing project, filtering projects by category, adding project logs etc.
* In order for all of the above to be available, user must first register and login in to the application.
* But, if you want just to explore the app there is a log in as guest option with limited access.
* Technologies used for the interface are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and Firebase for the backend.
* It can be used either on desktop or mobile.
* Project is live here: [project-management-web-a-5a8fe.web.app](https://project-management-web-a-5a8fe.web.app)
